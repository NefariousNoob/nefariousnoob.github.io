   <h1>TERMS</h1>
<li>1. License. You have the right to use any of my works as long as I am paid (for commissions) and proper credit is given.</li>
<li>2. Payment. Whenever I work for you, you must give me payment upfront to prevent scamming.</li>
<li>3. Messaging. Please do not message me if anything isn't comissions related.</li>
<li>4. Critism. Critism is allowed as long as it is constructive. (e.g. This looks like messy code, please fix it.) </li>
<h2> That's all you need to follow. Cheers!</h2>
